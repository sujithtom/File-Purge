# File-Purge
Utility to create an intersection of files when you have same file existing in multiple formats (e.g for images, RAW image and JPEG)

# Problem Statement
Personally while shooting pictures, I would like to shoot in RAW+JPEG mode. JPEG allows me to quickly review, shortlist/cull pictures on my lower spec portable laptop. I still want to edit the RAW pictures. This script allows me to cull JPEG images and then perform the same culling operation on RAW pictures.
